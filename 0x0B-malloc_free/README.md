Valgrind is an open-source programming tool used for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. It's widely used by developers to identify memory-related issues in their programs, such as memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and incorrect memory management. Valgrind works by running the target program in a virtual environment and monitoring its memory usage, which allows it to catch memory-related errors and provide detailed reports to help developers locate and fix the issues.
